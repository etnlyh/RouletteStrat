# Roulette Strategy Analysis: Monte Carlo Simulation

A Python-based simulation engine designed to quantify the long-term expected payoffs and volatility of various roulette betting systems (e.g., Martingale, Fibonacci, Labouchere). By running 10,000+ iterations, this tool visualizes the "Gambler's Ruin" and the impact of table limits on account balance sustainability.

# Key Features

• Strategy Modeling: Modular Python scripts to simulate complex betting logic.

• Monte Carlo Simulations: High-iteration testing (10,000+) to ensure statistical significance.

• Volatility Visualization: Comprehensive line graphs generated via Matplotlib to track account balance fluctuations and "drawdown" events.

• Risk Quantification: Comparative analysis of expected payoffs vs. theoretical house edges.
